Quirkful is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which adds special meta abilities that can be used by players in-game. The mod and its meta abilities (referred to as "Quirks" in-game) are all inspired by/originate from the anime/mange series [My Hero Academia](https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/My_Hero_Academia_(Anime)).

The mod aims to add every single quirk that is listed on the [My Hero Academia wiki](https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Quirk#List_of_Quirks), allowing for a unique and interesting gameplay experience even when playing by yourself or with friends.


Currently, the mod is still in very early and active development. So expect issues such as bugs within Quirks/general bugs, Quirks not working properly or Quirks outright not working.

For those looking to work on Quirkful and contribute to its development, you can refer to the section going over [setting up a development environment and building the mod from source](#-building-from-source).
